# EulerProject
==============

Repo to hold Euler project exercises, written in python.
Nothing fancy here. I would accept any PR with better solution (if tested).

I strongly discourage anyone to read my problems implementation without having its own before.
All the fun of the euler project is to find a solution by yourself...
