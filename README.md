# EulerProject
==============

Repo to hold Euler project exercises, written in Python3.
Nothing fancy here. I would accept any PR with a better solution that I understand (if tested).

I strongly discourage anyone to read my problems implementation without having its own before.
All the fun of the euler project is to find a solution by yourself...

At the beginning of this project, I used Legacy Python but almost all exercices has been ported to Python3 now. Some of them are no more compatible with Legacy Python (2.7). Deal with it.
